				<h2>What optimization is and why is it needed?</h2>
				<p>There are countless active and even abandoned sites on the Internet. Most of them match not only in
					categories, but also in content.</p>
				<p>Imagine thousands of websites that provide the same information or sell the same service in one way or
					another. And you can get to these sites only by thematic queries in search engines.</p>
				<p>But what do you do if your site is similar to a hundred or a thousand of the same, and on one page of Google
					or Yandex only 10 positions? How do I bring visitors to my resource's page? This is what optimization is
					for-to bring your site to the first page of the search!</p>
				<strong>We will teach you how to make your site attractive to search engines and advise you on how to bring it
					to the first pages, bypassing all competitors</strong>
